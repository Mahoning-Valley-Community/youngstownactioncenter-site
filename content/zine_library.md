## The Guillo-Zine Project

In conjunction with the Trans Liberation Front of Ohio, the Youngstown Action Center now houses and maintains The Guillo-Zine Project! The Guillo-Zine Project is an on-going program focused on the creation, distribution, and preservation of communist, anarchist, socialist, trans, queer, and solidarity/mutual-aid-based [zines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine).

The Guillo-Zine project is currently in development and will soon be launching a free, online database of its zine catalogue. At this time, however, the Guillo-Zine Library's physical catalogue is open by request only.

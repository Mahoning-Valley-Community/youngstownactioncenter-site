## The Mahoning Valley Solidarity Library

The Youngstown Action Center is proud to house the Mahoning Valley Solidarity Library, a collection of hundreds of books on socialism, progressive political movements, political history, climate and environmental justice, racial justice, and more. 

Located on the YAC's second floor, the Mahoning Valley Solidarity Library represents decades of socialist history and political movements and is a testament to the indomitable spirit of progressive thought and action.

The Mahoning Valley Solidarity Library is a living project. Its caretakers update its catalogue weekly. 

The YAC and the MVSL librarians are hard at work on ways to open the catalogue to the public. Until then, the Solidarity Library is open by request only.

## Who Are We?

The Youngstown Action Center is your community space for radical action. We are a collective of activists, artists, and organizers working together to create and maintain projects that serve the residents of Youngstown and the greater Mahoning Valley. We support and house initiatives that align with our shared values of equality, justice, sustainability, and cooperation. We build the world that we want to see.

## Welcome to the YAC!

We are the Youngstown Action Center.

The YAC, as it is affectionately known to the many organizers, activists, and other individuals who use it, was established in 2022. For years the YAC has been home to a variety of programs and organizations working to enact climate and environmental justice, racial justice, labor justice, liberation for the LGBTQIA+ community, and support for various solidarity movements at home and worldwide. Now, under new stewardship circa 2025, the YAC continues its mission of operating a collectively owned, collectively run, and collectively maintained community center. 

Housed in a three-story building with a wheelchair accessible first floor and located just a few minutes from Wick Park, the YAC offers a variety of rooms, equipment, and support for community members and organizations seeking space to co-work, hold meetings, celebrate, socialize, and collaborate on projects that benefit Youngstown and the Greater Mahoning Valley.

## Explore the YAC

The YAC is always evolving. As of September 2025, we are undergoing some minor construction and reorganization. If and when you visit, please excuse our mess.

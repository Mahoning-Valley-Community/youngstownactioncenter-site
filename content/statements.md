# On War
Mahoning Valley Democratic Socialists of America opposes war
because it always serves the ends of capital at the expense of
working people. This includes the “forever wars” in which the
United States is currently engaged, as well as the Biden Administration’s
plans for future bloodshed with Iran and Venezuela.
War squanders energy, the commonwealth, and human life
at a time where our planet is endangered by collapses in our ecology,
our economy, and our global public health.
We stand in solidarity with the people who make up the working classes
of the world regardless of what side of an international border they
may be standing on; therefore, a war against any people is a war against
all people, and a war against the American working class.
We recognize wars of imperialism as being continuously borne out of capital’s
need to concentrate wealth upward into the hands of the elite;
therefore, our rejection of war is the rational expression of valuing
people over profit.

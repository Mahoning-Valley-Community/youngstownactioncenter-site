## Who Are We?

The Youngstown Action Center is your community space for radical action. We are a collective of activists, artists, and organizers working together to create and maintain projects that serve the residents of Youngstown and the greater Mahoning Valley. We support and house initiatives that align with our shared values of equality, justice, sustainability, and cooperation. We build the world that we want to see. We are the YAC.

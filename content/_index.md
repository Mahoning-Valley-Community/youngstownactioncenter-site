Whether you live in Warren or Kinsman, Youngstown or Salem,
Mahoning Valley DSA is a meeting place and organizing space for socialists.
We meet regularly to socialize, discuss politics, and lobby for Medicare for All. 

As socialists, our group is open to anyone who lives, works, or goes to school
in Trumbull, Mahoning, or Columbiana County.  We are a place to grow, build power,
and learn together with respect for one another.

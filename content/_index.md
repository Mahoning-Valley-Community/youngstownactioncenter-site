## Welcome to the Youngstown Action Center
Welcome to the Youngstown Action Center, a welcoming, queer-friendly DIY community run space for meeting, co-working, events, community meals, and more - including a movement library - located minutes from YSU and downtown Youngstown at 107 Park Avenue.

We come together to share our passion for worker justice, environmental and climate justice, racial justice, reproductive freedom, LGBTQAI+ community support and freedom, local sustainability, and robust democratic processes.

Follow us on Facebook to get invites to events and updates about what's going on with us!
Support us through our donation portal at Open Collective, a great, super transparent online fiscal sponsor.

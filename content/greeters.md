## The Community Greeters

The Community Greeter Team was started in 2023 in response to an instance of right-wing violence against a guest at a local Pride festival. Established first under the Mahoning Valley DSA and then transferred
to the Youngstown Action Center for continued stewardship and development, the Community Greeters grew from a vision of community service. Our goal was to provide individuals trained in de-escalation, marshaling, and crowd management techniques to local events, who could act as both a friendly face to guests and as a safety team. These "Greeters" would interact with hosts, guests, and community members in a supportive and affirming manner. 

Since its establishment, the Community Greeter Program has grown significantly, and what began as a service for one event has gone on to serve many across our community. The Greeters have continued to develop and refine our practices and provide support for vulnerable communities across a wide spectrum of events and actions. Perhaps you've even noticed our Greeters wearing their yellow vests at an event you've attended!

We pride ourselves on being friendly and welcoming faces for guests at events throughout our community, helping
manage crowds, and keeping everyone safe, healthy, and happy. We are always looking to organize more training and to be available for new events - keep up to date by following the Greeters on social media!
